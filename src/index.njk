                <summary class="faq__question">How long will it take to develop the website?</summary>
                <div class="faq__answer">
                    This largely depends on the size of your websites and what's going to be worked on. There are many things to tackle, such as branding, copyright, and the code of the website to take into consideration. A standard website with 4/5 pages, though, can take approximately 2 weeks. A bigger site would take longer than that. If you have questions or concerns regarding the turn-around time, let's get in touch and see if we can meet your deadline.

                <summary class="faq__question">How does hosting work?</summary>
                <div class="faq__answer">
                    Once the website is complete, we can setup your website with any website hosting service out there. You can either pick, or we choose one we're most familiar with. This is the best thing about what we do. You're not locked to a single place to host your website. That being said, if you opt in for the maintenance plan, we'll take care of everything.

            <details class="faq__item">
                <summary class="faq__question">Will I be able to make changes on my website?</summary>
                <div class="faq__answer">
                    You are 100% able to make changes on your site, and we really do mean YOUR site. The way we do things though, it's not very easy to do so as it requires some coding knowledge. That being said, we recommend having someone that knows what they're doing to make the changes as to not negatively impact SEO or the website itself.

                <summary class="faq__question">How do I pay?</summary>
                <div class="faq__answer">
                    After the discover call, we send over a proposal requiring 50% of the agreed upon amount. Once the project is complete, we require the remaining 50% and that is when we transfer the site to you (even if you opt for the maintenance plan, you get full access to the site code).

                <summary class="faq__question">What sort of content will I need to send?</summary>
                <div class="faq__answer">
                    We will need things like logos, images of workers and people working, specific copyright you may want, brand colors, and a domain name if you already have one. If you lack the content we need to build the site, that's something we can help with, but will require more financial investment and time.
